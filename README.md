# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

## Description

This project involves extracting historical stock price data and revenue data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME), and visualizing this data using interactive plots. The goal is to create a clear representation of the relationship between stock prices and revenue over time.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- `yfinance`: For fetching historical stock data.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `requests`: For fetching HTML data from the web.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML data.
- `plotly`: For creating interactive plots.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas requests beautifulsoup4 plotly
